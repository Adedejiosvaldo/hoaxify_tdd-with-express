# Test-Driven Development in Express

This project is a demonstration of implementing test-driven development (TDD) in an Express application. TDD is a software development approach that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. By following this approach, we can ensure that our code is reliable, maintainable, and bug-free.
